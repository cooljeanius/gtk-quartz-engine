Theme
=====

* Expander, regular button:
    kind = kThemeDisclosureButton
    value = kThemeDisclosureRight
    adornment = kThemeAdornmentNone
* Spinbutton, regular button:
    kind = kThemeIncDecButton (and *Mini, *Small...)
* Optionmenu/combobox
* Entry needs fixing the background outside its border
* Entries/buttons etc are drawn outside of their normal bounds, can
  use GetThemeButtonBackgroundBounds to account for this?
* Animation (e.g. default button pulsation) needs to be emulated


GTK+
====

* Make invisible-char a style property? 
* Add xsetting for enabling/disabling mnemonics?
